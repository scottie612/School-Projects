Dijkstras Implementation

I took the code from the textbook and implemented it into python. I also made it so that it prints the path it took to get
the shortest path along with the total distance for each node. (see dijkstra's output.png)

I decided to implement the graph discussed in lecture "ACN-P5-long.pdf" as vertices(nodes) and edges(distances to neighbors)
